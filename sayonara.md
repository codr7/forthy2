Alrighty then, moment of truth.

The computer is no more and unless a miracle happens I'm forced to leave my home tomorrow with my life in a bag and no money.

I spent the last four years working on [forthy2](https://github.com/codr7/forthy2) in [one](https://gitlab.com/sifoo/snigl) form or [other](https://github.com/codr7/cidk), more or less full time. The ashes of the earliest prototypes have since been spread to rest in peace, but many [iterations](https://github.com/TryItOnline/cixl) and design [documents](https://github.com/TryItOnline/cixl/tree/master/devlog) may still be found intact out there.

15 years ago I was in a serious climbing accident, where I fell 20m and smashed a vertibrae into pieces. They somehow managed to get my spine into semi-working order by building a titanium bridge over the damaged part. So it works, as long as I don't do anything out of the ordinary, and as long as I don't have to sit still for too long. As long as I can lie down when it gets unbearable, or go for a walk. Whatever is needed to stay sane.

I've been writing code in one form or other since I was 8 years old. I'm 42 now, so that's 34 years of deliberate daily practice. During that time I worked as a professional software developer for 15 years, in various roles and companies of different kinds. Unfortunately, that level of experience in combination with the integrity that comes with age makes it even less likely that someone would want to employ me.

So that's more or less where I found myself four years ago; with more experience than I could wish for, and plenty of good ideas for a new programming language. But no money. You can thank the German state, my partner and her now empty savings account for getting us this far; without them it could never have happened.

The general idea was that if I do my absolute best to make the world just a little bit brighter for others, life would find a way to make that sustainable. So I added different means of making donations. Thinking that if you find something interesting or useful that was given to you for free you wouldn't mind separating with a few numbers to return the favor. The amount I would have needed for basic stuff like food, rent and medicine should have been totally doable; even within the 100 or so strong circle of fans that have swirled around the language along the way.

But it just didn't happen. 

It's not that I'm bitter; you really can't expect others to care, especially with all the distractions out there these days. 

I find it mostly sad, because I just needed a tiny bit of help to turn this into something good and now the whole thing is on its way down the drain for no good reason, together with the rest of my life. So I figured the least I could do is share my story, in hope of creating enough awareness to make life a little bit easier for the next person to end up here. 

Which finally brings us to the core problem in this so called civilization; until people have walked in someone else's shoes and fought the same demons, it's seems impossible for most to feel empathy. Not very civilized if you ask me.

Anyways,
Sayonara, and thanks for all the fish,
it's been weird.
